I've been setting up most of my development environments in the last 3 years using [docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) without any [important](https://forums.docker.com/t/file-access-in-mounted-volumes-extremely-slow-cpu-bound/8076/40) issues. Having said that, in the last couple of month I've repeating the following script (with some variations cases by case) in most of my projects.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

case "$1" in
  server)
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm -p 8080:8080 yarn start
    ;;
  build)
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm app yarn build
    ;;
  test)
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm app yarn test
    ;;
  bash)
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm -p 8080:8080 server /bin/bash
    ;;
esac
```

I always ended up writing a call to `docker-compose` depending on the task I need to perform with some flag or arguments variations.

At the same time, I've spend some time working on different projects that had multiple ways of running it and lacked a simple documentation on what tasks were available inside the project.

I realized that this small script that I duplicated in most of my applications could be better expressed in a declarative fashion using a yaml file.

## Hi [sdev.sh](https://github.com/bilby91/sdev.sh)

[sdev.sh](https://github.com/bilby91/sdev.sh) purpose is simple, Simple declarative syntax for your projects tasks.

Previous bash script is now expressed as:

```yaml
version: 1
name: My Cool App
description: This text should briefly mention what the application/library is about
docker:
  compose_file: docker/docker-compose.yml
tasks:
  - name: server
    description: Start the development server
    command: yarn start
    container: app
    rm: true
    ports:
      "8080:8080"

  - name: build
    description: This command will build the entire application and install dependencies
    command: yarn build
    container: app
    rm: true

  - name: test
    description: run unit test suite.
    command: yarn test
    container: app

  - name: bash
    description: ssh in docker container
    command: /bin/bash
    container: app
    ports:
      "8080:8080"
```

Using that yaml file as input, sdev will generate the following command for you.

```bash
âžœ  sdev.sh git:(improve-readme) âœ— sdev

  Usage: sdev [options] [command]

  This text should briefly mention what the application/library is about


  Options:

    -V, --version  output the version number
    -h, --help     output usage information


  Commands:

    build       This command will build the entire application and install dependencies
    test        run unit test suite.
    bash        ssh in docker container
    help [cmd]  display help for [cmd]
```

The code is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/bilby91/sdev.sh).

I'm looking for more cool features that could be built in sdev.sh. If you think this tool might be useful in your projects, I want to hear about it :). Ping me at fmartin91@gmail.com

Enjoy ðŸŽ‰
